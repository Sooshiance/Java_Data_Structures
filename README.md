# **Data Structure**

The Data Structures are categorized into two parts :

<h2> <a href="#linear">Linear</a> </h2>

<h2> <a href="#non-linear">non-Linear</a> </h2>

This repo will has a full review on Data Structure in **Java**.

I will practice with most important methods of DSA during the code,
and I will write guidelines for other methods.

## **Linear**

### Arrays

**Array** is a collection of elements, each identified by an array `index`. Arrays are stored in contiguous memory locations, which allows for efficient access to elements using their indices. In Java, arrays are `fixed` in size once they are created.

### Queue

**Queue** is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out `(FIFO)` principle. Elements are added at the `rear` and removed from the `front`. Common operations include `enqueue` (add an element to the rear) and `dequeue` (remove an element from the front).

### Stack

**Stack** is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out `(LIFO)` principle. Elements are added and removed from the `top` of the stack. Common operations include `push` (add an element), `pop` (remove the top element), and `peek` (view the top element without removing it).

### String

**String** is a sequence of characters. In Java, strings are objects of the String class and are immutable, meaning once a string is created, it cannot be changed. Strings are widely used for storing and manipulating text.

### Linked List

**Linked List** is a linear data structure where elements are stored in `nodes`. Each node contains the `data` and a `reference` to the next node in the sequence. Linked lists allow for efficient insertion and deletion of elements, but accessing elements by index is `less` efficient compared to arrays.
